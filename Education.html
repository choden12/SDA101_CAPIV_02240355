            In early 2011, I enrolled in class PP at Wombur Primary School, 
            which is located in the lower part of Lhuntse Dzongkhag.

            From there, I transferred to Minjey Middle Secondary School for my secondary education.
            It was a great opportunity to study and explore new things, and I stayed there from classes 3 to 10.

            Fortunately, I qualified for higher secondary school and transferred to a new school, 
            one of the most renowned in the country. Lhuntse Higher Secondary School was one of 
            the most memorable schools, as it taught me important values and set great examples of 
            how to be a good human being. I stayed there for two years.
