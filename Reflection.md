# Reflection on Developing Personal Profile using HTML/CSS

## Introduction
The main aim of this project is to develop a design using HTML and CSS, based on the personal profile created in figma.

## What I Learned
I have learned that figma’s design tools offer more flexibility compared to HTML and CSS. However, this process has helped me learn how to effectively use a variety of HTML and CSS features to bring the project closer to the design vision improving my skills in both layout and styling.

## Challenges Faced
I have realized that converting designs from Figma into code is more challenging than it initially seemed, particularly when it comes to precisely matching sizes and spacing. It’s difficult to replicate exact measurements and positioning.

## How I Overcame Challenges
To overcome this challenge, I received help from my classmates  and I also sought help online.

## Strengths and Weaknesses
My strength in completing this project lies in my hard work and ability to meet deadlines. Weaknesses could be few image i really dont know how to code but i will put extra effort to overcome this weakness.

## Future Improvements
Moving forward, to ensure the best outcomes for future assignments, I will avoid leaving assignment for the last moment and manage my time more effectively.

## Conclusion
As mentioned, this project involved transforming an image into code, and throughout the process, I’ve learned a lot. It has been incredibly helpful in deepening my understanding of HTML and CSS.
