            <h3>Dancing</h3>
            <p>Dancing has become a deep passion of mine over the years. While I may not claim to be the best dancer, <br>
                 my dedication and love for it are undeniable. As a member of the cultural team in both middle school <br>
                 and high school, I have had the opportunity to participate in performances and express myself through <br>
                 dance. Itâ€™s not just about skill for me; itâ€™s about the joy and freedom that dancing brings.</p>

            <h3>Time Management</h3>
            <p>I can determine what tasks are most important and tackle them first, ensuring deadlines are met.</p>
