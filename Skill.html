            <h3>Dancing</h3>
            <p>
                Dancing has become a deep passion of mine over the years. While I may not claim to be the best dancer, my dedication and love for it are undeniable. As a member of the cultural team in both middle school and high school, I've had the opportunity to participate in performances and express myself through dance. It's not just about skill for me â€“ itâ€™s about the joy and freedom that dancing brings.

            <p>
                I can determine what tasks are most important and tackle them first, ensuring deadlines are met.
